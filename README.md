# uQuadProg
uQuadProg is a C++ routine for solving quadratic programming problems. 
It implements the [Goldfarb-Idnani active-set dual method](http://www.javaquant.net/papers/goldfarbidnani.pdf).  
uQuadProg is a porting of the  QuadProg++ package (developed by Luca Di Gaspero) working with uBlas data structures for vectors and matrices instead of native C++ arrays.
