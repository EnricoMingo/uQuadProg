# uQuadProg
uQuadProg is a C++ routine for solving quadratic programming problems. 
It implements the [Goldfarb-Idnani active-set dual method](http://www.javaquant.net/papers/goldfarbidnani.pdf).  
uQuadProg is a porting of the  [QuadProg++](https://github.com/liuq/QuadProgpp) package (developed by [Luca Di Gaspero](http://www.diegm.uniud.it/digaspero/)) working with uBlas data structures for vectors and matrices instead of native C++ arrays.
